# COVID-19 Impact on US Real Estate Market

This project analyzes how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the US real estate market, focusing on changes in both **home values** and **rent values** from **March 2020 to September 2022**, compared with a similar 5-year pre-pandemic period (**March 2015 to December 2019**).

## Project Components:
- **Workflow**: Built in **Alteryx** (`Covid Impact on US Real Estate Market.yxmd`)
- **Datasets**:
  - `Home+Values.csv`
  - `Rent+Values.csv`
- **Final Report**: Detailed analysis and key insights (`Final_Report.pdf`)
- **Workflow Image**: High-level view of the data process (`Final_workflow.png`)

## Analysis Highlights:
- Compared percentage changes in home values and rent values across regions.
- Calculated a "Covid Impact Delta" to measure the difference.
